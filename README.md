# ðŸŒ€ Basic Raytracing in C++

A minimal yet powerful implementation of a raytracer from scratch, written in modern C++. This project is based on the renowned book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ by Peter Shirley_], and is a great foundation for anyone learning computer graphics, ray-object intersection, camera modeling, and shading.

This repository walks through the core concepts of ray tracing: rays, spheres, shading, anti-aliasing, diffuse reflection, and more â€” all crafted with clarity and simplicity.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

The renderer outputs a simple PPM image file (`.ppm`), which can be viewed with most image viewers or converted using ImageMagick or similar tools.
