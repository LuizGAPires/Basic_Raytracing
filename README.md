# ðŸŒ€ Basic Raytracing in C++

A minimal yet powerful implementation of a raytracer from scratch, written in modern C++. This project is based on the renowned book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ by Peter Shirley_], and is a great foundation for anyone learning computer graphics, ray-object intersection, camera modeling, and shading.

> ðŸŽ“ **Project developed for a Graphic Computing course** of the first semester of 2024
> As part of academic exploration into rendering pipelines, ray-object math, and image synthesis techniques.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

The renderer outputs a simple PPM image file (`.ppm`), which can be viewed with most image viewers or converted using ImageMagick or similar tools.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Custom vector math implementation (`vec3`)
- âœ… Basic ray-object intersection
- âœ… Scene made of spheres (`hittable_list`)
- âœ… Ray-sphere intersection
- âœ… Color shading based on ray depth
- âœ… Anti-aliasing
- âœ… Recursive ray bouncing for diffuse materials
- âœ… Outputs `.ppm` image
